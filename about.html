							<h3>So... why make this?</h3>
							<p>This is a small segment addressing some frequently asked questions about my career choices and also, my first knee-deep dive into languages Javascript, CSS and HTML (as this website is custom-coded) between university terms! Hooray for continued development in a 2-day time quantum!</p>

							<p></p>
							<h3>What were your first steps out of University?</h3>
							<p>On graduation, I learned market automation to be the key problem all graduates face for self-marketing or corporate applications. So I've leveraged everything I've learned to specialise in data science applications which arm senior management with the marketing data they deserve to have. </p>
							<h3>...So why Computer Science?</h3>
							<p>When reading more about data science, I discovered it's simply a small segment of the greater puzzle which is computer science! Grabbing the bull by the horns, I'm currently integrating as much computational theory into my value proposition as soon as possible, starting with the Computer Science Masters!</p>

						<h3>Where's the middle ground in Marketing and Computer Science?</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>I believe there's unbound complexity in simplicity. Einstein said it best - if you can't tell explain it simply, then you don't know it well enough at all! Sometimes, the best marketing you can do is as simple as grabbing a megaphone and making some noise, but making real change or pushing an innovative product requires accurate cross-disciplinary abstraction.</p>
						<p>Marketing and Computer Science currently meet somewhere between insights analysis and front-end web development. Designing and engineering marketing dashboards to track real-time analytics data and allowing businesses to use this real-time data will be key in developing the area as an established intermediary. In other words, it's the middle ground between our digital tools and human behaviour.</p>
						<h3>How do we track human behavour?</h3>
						<p> Currently, we use tracking cookies, digital fingerprinting and sometimes very-invasive methods of consumer profile development which involves a handful of tracking tagging your online browsing habits for commoditised dealings. Some laws, like the most recent GDPR integration within the European Union are an active attempt at preventing en-mass data collection, but the truth is, we don't actually know if a company stops collecting your data after you've requested them to stop.</p>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>The answer to what is precisely left to investigate between fields is exactly what I'm working on, and much of it will remain well-guarded. However, public domain has already begun to fund research into addictive UX methods to keep players hooked on digital mechanics in effort to extract maximum real-world currency, and it works! How this will develop over the next decade is a key point of interest for me and my career and I will remain keenly interested in the ethical ramifications of such technological application on the human psyche. </p>
						<p>Many people believe their own pysche is unavailable to manipulation, but if that was true, you most likely wouldn't have read this far. If you scroll back up, you'll see I frontloaded you with colourful images after a vicariously designed graduation celebration picture below the word "hooray" to evoke nostalgia and positive connotations to your own graduation, or to pique your interest in one of the many pictures within the boxed canvas. Each paragraph of text gradually grows larger, slightly noticable to you, but you've read so much already it'd be a waste to stop now, right? That's called the sunk-cost fallacy. Sometimes, a positively-reinforced nudge is all it takes.</p>
						<p>Though I must admit, there are some questions I doubt many people will ever find the answer for. Does P = NP? Is public-key cryptography possible? Can integer factorisation be done in polynomial time on a non-quantum computer? Why is this guy wearing gloves and goggles to use the computer? I guess there's some things we'll never know!</p>
